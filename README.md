## Purpose

This is just a basic online portfolio. The main purpose is to let people who might be looking to hire me have look at the projects that I am working on. The MAIN main purpose is to have somewhere to say, "Hey, I'm working on these projects, but they are still in developement, so I can't really send you a link yet - maybe just read about them here for now!" 

## To Do

* [x] Get the header part of the page working and add an under construction banner.
* [x] "Projects" section - For now just get the list up and styled. You can add more elaborate project descriptions, demos, etc. later.
* [ ] "Find-me" section - Provide a place where they can get at all your profiles that might be relevant (github, linkedin, SO, ???).
* [ ] "Contact" -- not sure if I want/need a contact section yet...think about it. 
* [ ] Add some effects so it's not too bland (smooth scroll, cool icons, maybe some css animations, that new header/footer thing you were thinking about trying, etc.)
